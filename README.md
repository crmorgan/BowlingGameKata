# The Bowling Game Kata
This is a C# version of the Uncle Bob's kata that I will be using for teaching TDD to people new to it.

Uncle Bob's version is at [http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata "http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata")


In the `/src` directory there is a completed version of all five tests but I would recommend not looking at that and using the steps in the Bowling Game Kata.pptx slides and don't go to the next test until you are really comfortable with the previous one.
